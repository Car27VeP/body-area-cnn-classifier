# Body Area Classifier.


On this project, a customized deep learning model was constructed layer by layer to detect and clasify various body areas images. The model was designed for image classification using data sourced from Google Images. All training images are organized within a single folder, with distinct classes stored in separate subfolders named after their respective class names. The subsequent steps and procedures undertaken will be elaborated upon in a step-by-step manner.
